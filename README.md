# Advanced Lane Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Advanced Lane Detection** is a computer vision–based project designed to detect and track road lane markings using image processing and classical computer vision techniques. The system processes road images and video streams to identify lane boundaries in real time.

This project demonstrates foundational concepts in:

* Image preprocessing
* Feature extraction
* Perspective transformation
* Polynomial curve fitting
* Real-time video processing

It serves as a practical introduction to intelligent transportation systems and autonomous driving technologies.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Detect lane lines from road images and videos
* Apply image filtering and edge detection techniques
* Perform perspective (bird’s-eye view) transformation
* Fit polynomial curves to lane boundaries
* Overlay detected lanes onto the original video frames
* Generate an output video with detected lanes


## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* MoviePy
* Matplotlib

## 📊 Output

* Detected lane boundaries visualized on each video frame
* Curvature estimation of lane lines
* Vehicle position relative to lane center
* Output video file generated automatically
