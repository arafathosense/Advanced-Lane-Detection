# Advanced Lane Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Advanced Lane Detection** is a computer vision–based project designed to detect and track road lane markings using image processing and classical computer vision techniques. The system processes road images and video streams to identify lane boundaries in real time.

This project demonstrates foundational concepts in:

* Image preprocessing
* Feature extraction
* Perspective transformation
* Polynomial curve fitting
* Real-time video processing

It serves as a practical introduction to intelligent transportation systems and autonomous driving technologies.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Detect lane lines from road images and videos
* Apply image filtering and edge detection techniques
* Perform perspective (bird’s-eye view) transformation
* Fit polynomial curves to lane boundaries
* Overlay detected lanes onto the original video frames
* Generate an output video with detected lanes


## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* MoviePy
* Matplotlib


## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository

Download the project files and open the folder using **PyCharm** (or any Python IDE).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open the terminal inside the project directory and run:

```bash
pip uninstall moviepy -y
pip install moviepy==1.0.3
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed on your system.

### Step 3: Run the Program

Execute the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The processed output will be displayed and saved as a video file in the project directory.


## 📊 Output

* Detected lane boundaries visualized on each video frame
* Curvature estimation of lane lines
* Vehicle position relative to lane center
* Output video file generated automatically



## 🔬 Research Significance

Lane detection is a critical component of:

* Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)
* Autonomous vehicles
* Intelligent transportation systems

Future research directions include:

* Deep learning–based lane detection (e.g., CNN-based segmentation models)
* Robust detection under adverse conditions (night, rain, shadows)
* Real-time embedded system optimization
* Integration with object detection and path planning systems

This project builds a strong foundation for further research in:

* Artificial Intelligence
* Computer Vision
* Robotics
* Autonomous Systems

Such research may contribute to academic publications, graduate-level study, and industry applications in intelligent mobility.
